## About me

I am a research scientist in the Visual Representation Learning group at [Naver Labs Europe](https://europe.naverlabs.com/). I received my Ph.D. from the Computer Vision Center in the Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Spain, supervised by Ernest Valveny and Alicia Forn√©s. My research interests lie in the fields of computer vision and machine learning, currently with a focus on learning representations for image retrieval, both in a supervised and self-supervised way, object detection, and semantic segmentation. For a full list of my publications please visit my [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0dUAE_EAAAAJ&hl=en), and to know more about some of my open-sourced projects please visit my [GitHub page](https://github.com/almazan).
